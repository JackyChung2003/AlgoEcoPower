# AlgoEcoPower Frontend

## Overview

This project's frontend component is designed to interact with the [AlgoEcoPower smart contract](https://github.com/JackyChung2003/AlgoEcoPower/tree/main/Backend)
, providing users with a seamless interface to access and utilize the functionalities of the smart contract.

## Smart Contract Integration

This frontend component interacts with a smart contract that powers the backend of our application. Below are the key functions and flows tailored to our project's energy management system:

- **User Account and Energy Tracking:** Users can register and create accounts using the smart contract. The smart contract tracks and displays the following key metrics:
  - `Token Balance`: Users can check their token balance.
  - `Generated Energy`: Users can monitor the energy generated by their solar panels.
  - `Uploaded Energy`: Users can keep track of the energy they've uploaded to the system.
  - `Purchased Energy`: Users can view their purchased energy consumption.

- **Top-up System (To Be Implemented):** The project includes a top-up system to allow users to add tokens to their accounts for energy transactions.

- **Developer Mode:** The developer mode provides functionalities to modify energy and token balances for testing purposes. It allows for resetting variables to normal values to aid in demonstration. Additionally, it facilitates interactions with other users to simulate energy transactions.

- **Threshold Management:** Users can set energy thresholds to automatically sell excess energy. They can define the threshold levels and the pricing for energy sales.

- **Marketplace:** Users can purchase energy from other users in the marketplace. They have the option to edit the price of the energy they upload or retrieve energy from the system back to their solar battery.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
