# AlgoEcoPower Frontend

## Overview

This project's frontend component is designed to interact with the [AlgoEcoPower smart contract](https://github.com/JackyChung2003/AlgoEcoPower/tree/main/Backend)
, providing users with a seamless interface to access and utilize the functionalities of the smart contract.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Smart Contract Integration

This frontend component interacts with a smart contract that powers the backend of our application. Below are the key functions and flows tailored to our project's energy management system:

- **User Account and Energy Tracking:** Users can register and create accounts using the smart contract. The smart contract tracks and displays the following key metrics:
  - `Token Balance`: Users can check their token balance.
  - `Generated Energy`: Users can monitor the energy generated by their solar panels.
  - `Uploaded Energy`: Users can keep track of the energy they've uploaded to the system.
  - `Purchased Energy`: Users can view their purchased energy consumption.

- **Top-up System (To Be Implemented):** The project includes a top-up system to allow users to add tokens to their accounts for energy transactions.

- **Developer Mode:** The developer mode provides functionalities to modify energy and token balances for testing purposes. It allows for resetting variables to normal values to aid in demonstration. Additionally, it facilitates interactions with other users to simulate energy transactions.

- **Threshold Management:** Users can set energy thresholds to automatically sell excess energy. They can define the threshold levels and the pricing for energy sales.

- **Marketplace:** Users can purchase energy from other users in the marketplace. They have the option to edit the price of the energy they upload or retrieve energy from the system back to their solar battery.
