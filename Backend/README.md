# AlgoEcoPower Smart Contract 

This is the AlgoEcoPower smart contract repository. AlgoEcoPower is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes peer-to-peer (P2P) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) interaction, enabling seamless buying, selling, and trading of energy. This smart contract plays a crucial role in facilitating these energy transactions on the Algorand blockchain.

## Overview
This repository contains a PyTeal-based smart contract designed for the Algorand blockchain. 
The purpose of this smart contract is to address a pressing challenge in the energy industry. 
Each year, billions of kilowatt-hours of energy go to waste in the traditional consumption model. 
AlgoEcoPower is on a mission to revolutionize the energy landscape by introducing a decentralized energy trading platform. 
This platform empowers users to participate in energy commerce, facilitating the efficient utilization of this valuable resource.
Our smart contract plays a pivotal role in facilitating these energy transactions on the Algorand blockchain.

## Smart Contract Details

It is deployed on the Algorand Testnet and has a relevant app index which can be found on any Algorand Network Explorer, such as AlgoExplorer.

### Approval Program

The approval program is a fundamental part of the smart contract. It defines the rules and conditions under which transactions can be approved. It utilizes global and local state variables to store, check, and update data as required by the contract's functionality. This program is written in PyTeal.

### Clear State Program

The clear state program defines how the smart contract's state should be cleared. It is also written in PyTeal and works in conjunction with the approval program to manage the state of the contract.

## Deployment

To deploy this smart contract on the Algorand Testnet, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Algorand development environment and ensure you have access to a Testnet account.

2. Compile the PyTeal scripts into Algorand smart contracts using the Algorand SDK. You can refer to Algorand's official documentation for more details.

3. Deploy the smart contract to the Algorand Testnet using your Algorand SDK and account credentials.

4. Once deployed, you can find the relevant app index on Algorand Network Explorer (e.g., AlgoExplorer) to interact with the contract.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how users or developers can interact with your smart contract. Include details on the functions available, how to call them, and what kind of data they can read and write to the smart contract's global and local states.

## Security and Validation

Explain the security measures and proper validation checks you've implemented to ensure the robustness and security of your smart contract. Highlight any potential vulnerabilities and how they have been mitigated.

## License

Specify the license under which your smart contract is released. You can choose from various open-source licenses, such as MIT, Apache, or others.

## Contact

Provide contact information or links to your social media profiles or email address in case users or developers have questions or need assistance with your smart contract.
